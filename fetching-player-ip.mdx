**Real-time Connection Monitoring System**

The **Live Connection Monitoring System** provides server owners with real-time visibility into active connections to their server. From the **Server Management** section, server owners can view a list of these connections, displaying key details such as source IP addresses, ports, and connection status.

To **ban an IP**, simply follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Client’s Source IP:** Navigate to the **Live Connection** tab within the Server Management section to view active connections.
2. **Match Source Port:** Cross-reference the source IP with the corresponding source port displayed in the **Live Connection** tab or within your server logs/console.
3. **Ban the IP:** Once you’ve identified the suspicious or unwanted connection, you can proceed to block or ban the IP directly from the server management interface.\
